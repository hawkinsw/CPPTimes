### What's News
Activist investors have made a record number of attempts this fiscal quarter to encourage conglomerates to spin off subsidiaries to unlock value. The investing instigators claim that these companies overall are underpriced in the market relative to the value of their individual businesses. To help with this analysis they are hiring a record number of people who can identify and name the valuable pieces of businesses. 

### Bjarne's Anatomy - The Parts

In order to move forward in our C++ education, we will all have to speak the same language. We are going to spend a tremendous amount of time during to fellow programmers about code -- what it does, why it does it and how to write it. If we do not have a shared vocabulary to talk about the components of a C++ program, that communication is going to be very difficult! 

Here is an annotated C++ program with different parts and pieces labeled:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
/*
 * This program will print Hello, World. A "Hello, World"
 * program is the first program that a developer writes in
 * a language they are learning.
 */
int main() {
    // Declare some variables.
    std::string hello{"Hello"};
    std::string world{"World"};
    // Print the output to screen.
    std::cout << hello << ", " << world << "!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Say It Like You Mean It

It's one thing to be able to say what each component of a program is, but it's another to be able to describe what that component means.

A *literal* is, well, *literally* what is written. If it is a string literal (e.g., `"Hello"`) then it is just a string. If it is an `int`eger literal (e.g., `5`), then it is just a number. And so on. These literals' values cannot change. Oh, what's that I just said? Yes, they have a value! 

*Expressions* also have values. In fact, that's the very definition of *expression*: anything with a value. In the program above, `0` in `return 0;`, `"Hello"` in `std::string hello{"Hello"};` and `hello` in `std::cout << hello << ", " << world << "!\n"` are expressions. Those aren't the only ones, though.

*Operators* are a symbol that represents some operation. For example, `*` is an operator in C++ that represents the multiplication operation (among other things [more on that later]). In the program above, `<<` is an operator. What good is an operation without some data to manipulate? The data upon which operators operate are known as *operands*. In the program above, `hello` and `"!\n"` are operands (among others). 

There are a few words in C++ that are off limits for programmers to use when they name their functions and variables and whose meaning is fixed by the language. Those words are known as *key words* (or *reserved words*). The key words in the program above are `int` and `return`. 

> Note: You can see the entire list of reserved words online at [cppreference]().

Finally, there are variables. *Variables* are named locations for storage in memory. The variables in the program above are `hello` and `world`.

### Follow The Rules

A programming language specifies a set of rules that you (the programmer) must follow to construct a valid program. The rules lay out the valid ways that you can arrange operators, key words, operands, expressions, literals, etc and still make a valid program. These rules are known as *syntax*. If you write a program that violates any of these rules, your program contains a *syntax error*.

Notice that we are using a very particular word: *valid*. Just because a program is *valid* does not mean that it is correct. It is very hard to specify what constitutes "correct" for any given task let alone whether a program that completes that task does so correctly. In this class (and most others) you will learn how to correct *valid* programs and learning how you can write tests to demonstrate that it is correct (and only occassionally will you touch on proving that the programs are *actually* correct).
