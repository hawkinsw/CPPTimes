# C++ Times

After every one of my Intro to Computer Science Using C++ classes (pun intended), I "publish" an edition of the C++ Times that recaps what we learned in class. This repository holds those notes.

I routinely remix these in order to match the speed of the course each semester, but these serve as the basis. 

If you would like to help with these materials, please feel free to submit fixes. I would love to have your contributions!
